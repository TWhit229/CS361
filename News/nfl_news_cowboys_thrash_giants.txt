Header: Dallas Cowboys Thrash New York Giants in Dominant Display

The Dallas Cowboys put on an impressive show on Sunday, overpowering the New York Giants 41-13 at AT&T Stadium. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was in top form, throwing for four touchdowns and leading his team to a decisive victory that further cemented their spot as NFC East frontrunners.

Prescott spread the ball around effectively, connecting with CeeDee Lamb, Michael Gallup, and tight end Dalton Schultz for scores. The Cowboys' running game also came to life, with Ezekiel Elliott rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown, adding to the Giants' woes on defense.

The Giants struggled to contain Dallas' high-powered offense, while their own offensive line was overwhelmed by the Cowboys' pass rush. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones was sacked five times and threw two interceptions, both picked off by Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs, who had an outstanding game.

Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy praised his team's balanced performance, stating, "We played complementary football today. The offense, defense, and special teams all did their part, and it showed in the result." The Cowboys will look to maintain their momentum as they head into their next matchup against the Washington Commanders, while the Giants face a tough road ahead as they try to bounce back from this defeat.
