Header: San Francisco 49ers Edge Out Seattle Seahawks in a Nail-Biter

The San Francisco 49ers secured a hard-fought 27-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in a game that went down to the wire at Levi's Stadium. Quarterback Brock Purdy led the 49ers to a thrilling win, throwing for two touchdowns and orchestrating a late drive that set up the game-winning field goal.

The Seahawks kept the game close throughout, with quarterback Geno Smith putting on a solid performance, throwing for 275 yards and two touchdowns. Seattle's wide receiver DK Metcalf had a standout game, catching both of Smith's touchdown passes, while running back Kenneth Walker III contributed with 85 rushing yards and a touchdown of his own.

Despite Seattle's efforts, the 49ers' defense stepped up in the crucial moments, with linebacker Fred Warner making key stops that halted the Seahawks' final drive. The 49ers' offense also benefited from the playmaking abilities of Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey, who combined for over 150 total yards and one touchdown.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan praised his team's resilience, stating, "It was a tough battle, but our guys never gave up. We fought until the very end, and that made the difference." With the win, the 49ers continue to keep pace in the competitive NFC West, while the Seahawks will need to regroup and prepare for their next matchup against the Los Angeles Rams.
