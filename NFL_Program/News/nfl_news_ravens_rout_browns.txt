Header: Baltimore Ravens Rout Cleveland Browns in One-Sided Contest

The Baltimore Ravens delivered a commanding performance on Sunday, defeating the Cleveland Browns 34-10 at M&T Bank Stadium. Led by quarterback Lamar Jackson, the Ravens dominated from start to finish, leaving no doubt about their superiority in this AFC North rivalry game.

Jackson accounted for four total touchdowns, throwing for three and rushing for another as the Ravens offense carved up the Browns defense. Tight end Mark Andrews was Jackson's favorite target, hauling in two touchdown passes, while wide receiver Rashod Bateman added another score.

The Browns struggled to find any offensive rhythm, with quarterback Deshaun Watson under constant pressure from the Ravens' defensive front. Watson was sacked three times and threw an interception, as the Browns managed only one touchdown, a short run by Nick Chubb late in the third quarter.

Ravens head coach John Harbaugh praised his team's focus and execution, stating, "We came in with a game plan, and our guys executed it to perfection. It was a great team effort on both sides of the ball." The Ravens' victory keeps them in the hunt for the top seed in the AFC, while the Browns face a tough climb to stay in playoff contention.
